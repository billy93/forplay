#summary Introduction to ForPlay: your first game.

= Introduction =

The easiest way to write a game using ForPlay is to start with the samples. Start by downloading some prerequisites:
 # ForPlay
 # Eclipse
 # Google Plugin for Eclipse

= Details =

Start by importing forplay/sample/peaphysics into Eclipse. You should have a project with a package structure similar to:
 * forplay/sample/peaphysics/core/ [core game code]
 * forplay/sample/peaphysics/flash/ [flash platform entry point]
 * forplay/sample/peaphysics/java/ [java platform entry point]
 * forplay/sample/peaphysics/html/ [html platform entry point]

Right click on PeaPhysicsGameJava.java in the java platform entry point, and select "Debug As" -> "Java Application". The Pea Physics sample should now run! Click the red GWT compile icon to compile the html platform entry point.
